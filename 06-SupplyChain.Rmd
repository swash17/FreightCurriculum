Ports and Their Impact on the Global Supply Chain

## Sea Port

Ports can serve a range of vessels including recreational watercraft, barges, ferries, and ocean-going cargo and passenger ships. The United States has over 150 deep-draft ports, which serve ocean-going ships.

Seaports are maritime facilities that can comprise one or more wharves where ships can dock to load and discharge cargo and passengers.

## Supply Chain Management

Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the coordination and management of a complex network of activities delivering a finished product to end-users or customers. 

The process includes sourcing raw materials and parts, manufacturing and assembling products, storage, order entry and tracking, distribution through the various channels, and finally delivery to the customer.

Seaports are functioning as platforms within global supply chains and global production networks. 

These supply chains are highly dynamic as they react to changes in global trade patterns, consumer preferences, and advances in supply chain management and information technology.

## The role of ports in the supply chain

1.Ports are a nexus in supply chains as they support the interaction between global supply chains and regional production and consumption markets. 

2.Global supply chains have become complex, pressuring the logistics industry to simultaneously improve their costs, performance, and resilience to disruptions.

3.Logistics services that still offer value may experience a debasement and become basic services, only generating a small margin. This is especially the case for physical added value.

4.The successful management of a supply chain is influenced by customer expectations, globalization, technological innovations, government regulation, competition, and sustainability concerns.

5.Within supply chains, corporations interact with external suppliers, internal departments, external distributors, and customers.

## Ports and Their Impact on the Global Supply Chain

1. An efficient supply chain relies on optimized relationships, effective technology, excellent information sharing and streamlined infrastructure.
2. Port efficiency impacts organizations throughout the supply chainâ€”suppliers, manufacturers, logistics service providers (LSPs), freight forwarders, cargo shipping lines and others.

3. Some of the problems with the current port system and discuss possible solutions to help streamline port and downstream supply chain operations:

A Lack of Visibility into Container Status Impacts Forward Planning

A supply chain platform that integrates with port and terminal systems with a minimum of extra configuration
A centralized view of container status and information, so one can see where all your shipments are at a glance
Detailed container content information, so you can link specific supplies, parts and finished products back to loading, unloading and transportation schedules

4. An Increase in Demand on Ports Can Make Carriers Less Efficient

Deep analytics into exactly how ports are processing your shipments
Predictive forecasting and modeling so you can proactively make changes to your fleet operations
At-a-glance and in-depth reporting on the movement of goods so you can quickly identify and resolve potential issues

5. Infrastructure and Transportation Within and Around a Port Makes a Big Difference

Optimize routing and fleet transport through artificial intelligence, machine learning and predictive analytics
Accurate tracking of exactly where your containers, trucks, chassis and other assets are through GPS positioning
Take into account specialized handling needs for different types of sensitive goods


6. Environmental Factors Can Impact on Ports and the Supply Chain

The latest updates from air, ocean, rail and motor carriers
Communications from airport, marine and rail terminals
Data from electronic logging devices, automated information systems and GPS location services
Air traffic, weather alerts and maritime conditions


7. Specialized Port Arrangements Can Take Advantage of a Centralized Supply Chain Platform
