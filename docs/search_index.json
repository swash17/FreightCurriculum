Truck remains the premiere mode of freight transportation through the past two decades. Further growth in the future with advancements in electric vehicles and automation. Other modes are meanwhile holding relatively stable throughout the years. Freight transportation movements are expected to increase over the next few decades as global populations grow and consumer spending power increases. The freight transportation system in the United States includes an extensive network of highways, railroads, waterways, pipelines, and airways: 958,000 miles of Federal-aid highways, 141,000 miles of railroads, 11,000 miles of inland waterways, and 1.6 million miles of pipelines. Figure 2.4 shows historical and forecasted mode share in ton-miles from 1990–2040. The data reveal that most freight transportation modes are expected to experience increased volumes, although the amount of expected growth will vary by mode, with pipelines projected to have negative growth to year 2040.
