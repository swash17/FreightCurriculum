Other modes are meanwhile holding relatively stable throughout the years. Freight transportation movements are expected to increase over the next few decades as global populations grow and consumer spending power increases. The freight transportation system in the United States includes an extensive network of highways, railroads, waterways, pipelines, and airways: 958,000 miles of Federal-aid highways, 141,000 miles of railroads, 11,000 miles of inland waterways, and 1.6 million miles of pipelines.

Figure 1.5: Freight Transportation Services Index 2016–2021 "],["intro-Freight_economy.html", "1.5 Freight Transportation and the Economy", " 1.5 Freight Transportation and the Economy The benefits of freight transportation to the economy are enormous. Freight transportation increases the value of goods by moving them to locations where they are worth more and encourages competition and production. Freight transportation also stimulates demand for goods and services and employs millions of people. Freight transportation infrastructure is a significant component of our nation’s wealth and productive capacity. From a macroeconomic perspective, transportation accounts for a significant share of the U.S. GDP. In 2000, purchases of transportation-related goods and services accounted for approximately 11 percent of GDP (USDOT BTS 2002). Only housing, health care, and food accounted for a greater share. For-hire transportation services, which include warehousing, contributed about 3.3 percent ($303 billion) to GDP. Many industries and businesses depend on their own transportation operations (primarily trucking) to move goods. These “in-house” transportation services contributed an additional $142 billion to the economy (USDOT BTS 2001b). Freight transportation also contributes to the economy by providing jobs to millions of people—an important indicator of economic growth. In 2000, more than 10 million people were employed in transportation-related industries, including for-hire services, vehicle manufacturing, and parts suppliers. For-hire transportation (including warehousing) employed more than 4.4 million workers, a majority of whom worked in freight-related jobs. Another 5.5 million people worked in transportation occupations in non transportation industries, such as truck drivers for grocery stores (USDOT BTS 2001b). Truck drivers, alone, accounted for nearly 70 percent of the total number of transportation occupational workers (USDOT BTS 2002b). Improvements in freight productivity help the United States maintain its competitive position in the world economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that productivity for the intercity trucking, railroad, air transport, and petroleum pipeline industries has improved over the last 20 years. "],["intro-Freight_movement.html", "1.6 Growing Freight Movement", " 1.6 Growing Freight Movement Improvements in railroad productivity resulted primarily from deregulation, divestiture of uneconomic lines, reductions in the labor force, and changes in technology and logistics. Productivity improvements in trucking resulted primarily from public investments in a high-quality national road network and deregulation. The volume of freight moved by the U.S. transportation system has grown dramatically in recent decades and is projected to increase nearly 70 percent by 2020. The liberalization of trade policies, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), internationalization of supply chains, and changes in transportation and information technologies have contributed to this increase in freight movement. As a share of the gross domestic product (GDP), U.S. exports and imports grew from 9 percent in 1960 to 23 percent in 2002. U.S. international trade is forecast to reach 37 percent of GDP by 2025. Trucks carried about 71 percent of all tonnage and 80 percent of the value of U.S. shipments in 1998. Even with growth in airfreight, maritime, and rail services, the percentage of urban interstates carrying more than 10,000 trucks daily is expected to increase from 27 percent in 1998 to 69 percent in 2020. In recent years, trade growth has increased the number of commercial vehicles on U.S. roadways and, indirectly, the potential demand for more productive and larger commercial trucks. Trucks move a majority of freight tonnage. In 2002, 7.9 million large trucks (trucks with six or more tires) were on the road, compared with 6.2 million in 1990, and trucks contributed to 7.5 percent of all vehicle miles traveled in 2002. Trucks transported the vast majority of freight by both weight and value in 2018 (68% and 73%, respectively). While pipelines and rail together accounted for over 25% of freight tonnage, they accounted for just over 12% of freight value. Domestic freight movement in 2018 totaled 16.5 billion tons with a total value of $14.8 billion.

Seaports are maritime facilities that can comprise one or more wharves where ships can dock to load and discharge cargo and passengers. Since the dawn of commerce, people have been using boxes, sacks, barrels and containers of varying sizes to transport goods over long distances. Now, an estimated 90% of the world’s goods are transported by sea.

Once the consignment is ready, the exporter will first select a particular shipping company whose container will come to its factory for cargo loading. After loading the containers, the containers are sealed and an identical no. or a particular id is given to the exporter so that they can track their goods. Now the Freight forwarder will arrange for the intermodal transport i.e. transporting the container from the exporter warehouse or factory to the designated shipping port for loading into the ships. Shipping: In the port, the container weights are measured, and the entries are made according to that. The container is stacked in the port in such a manner that they can be taken out easily as per the schedule of their assigned vessel. Now the container is ready to be loaded on the ship. Once the ship arrives, the container is brought from the port storage facility, near to the ship by container port trucks The container can be stored on the ship’s cargo hold, where container guides are provided to draw and place the container inside the hold. Once the ship reaches the destined port, the container will be unloaded by the port cranes, and it is transported to the port bay or warehouse using the port container trucks. Once the custody of the shipment is acquired by the Importer’s representative or by the freight forwarder, the cargo will be transported using intermodal transport to the importer’s warehouse where the container is unloaded. The empty container is now returned to the shipping line designated container yard, where it will wait for the next booking and onward journey.

For example, the truck may be restricted to travel only during certain times of day (to minimize conflicts during heavier traffic periods) and/or may not travel on certain roadways. In the case of the latter, there may be routes with bridges that cannot handle the weight load. The truck may also have to avoid higher-speed roadways, such as an interstate, because the weight prevents the vehicle from attaining higher speeds. In some cases, it may be necessary for the DOT to map out a specific route from the origin and destination. In some situations, one or more pilot vehicles (sometimes also referred to as escort vehicles) may also be required to travel with the tractor-trailer. See https://www.truckinfo.net/guide/what-is-a-pilot-car for more information on pilot vehicles.

This enforcement activity is essential to help project the roadway infrastructure (pavement, bridges, etc.) from costly damage. Some weigh stations are situated next to a highway and require trucks to pull off the highway, get weighed, and then re-enter the highway, such as the one located along I-10 in Florida shown in Figure 3.2. Some of these stations use static scales; that is, the trucks needs to stop temporarily to get weighed. Some the stations use weigh-in-motion (WIM) technology; that is, trucks can get weighed while they moving over the weight measurement device. See Telemetered Traffic Monitoring and Weigh-in-Motion Systems: How it Works to learn more about WIM technology (in particular, starting at 1:30 in the video). See https://www.fdot.gov/mcsaw/weighstationlisting.shtm for the locations of the roadside weigh stations in Florida.

"],["VehPerformanceChars.html", "Chapter 4 Freight Vehicle Performance Characteristics", " Chapter 4 Freight Vehicle Performance Characteristics This chapter discusses topics that affect the performance (e.g., acceleration) of commercial trucks on the highway system. It also discusses how these performance characteristics should be considered in the context of traffic operations issues. "],["acceleration.html", "4.1 Acceleration", " 4.1 Acceleration Vehicle acceleration is a function of tractive effort (the force used to propel the vehicle forward) and resistance forces (the forces that resist/impede the forward motion of a vehicle). The available tractive effort is a function of the powertrain (engine and transmission). The total tractive effort that can be utilized is also limited by the forces between the tire-pavement interface; however, this aspect is rarely the limiting factor given the large weights of commercial vehicles. 4.1.1 Tractive Effort Engine Commercial truck tractors are typically powered by a high displacement internal combustion engine. The ‘displacement’ refers to the combined volume of the combustion chambers (i.e., piston cylinders). For example, the PACCAR MX-13 engine has an internal displacement of 12.9 liters, in an inline-6 cylinder configuration. By comparison, a 2023 Honda Accord EX uses an internal combustion engine with 4 cylinders (inline) and a total displacement of 1.5 liters (source: https://www.automobile-catalog.com/car/2023/3170930/honda_accord_ex.html#gsc.tab=0). Figure 4.1: PACCAR MX-13 Tractor Engine The tractor internal combustion engines run on diesel fuel and have large horsepower and very large torque output. This is illustrated in Figure 4.2. The different colored lines correspond to variations of the base engine model configuration. Again, for comparison, the 2023 Honda Accord EX has maximum power (hp) of 192 and maximum torque (ft-lb) of 192. For the Honda Accord, the maximum horsepower and torque values are the same, but they are typically similar for passenger vehicle engines. Diesel commercial truck engines, however, are typically designed to have much higher torque values, which is needed to start accelerating from rest with a very heavy load. Figure 4.2: PACCAR MX-13 Engine Power and Torque Output Transmission Again, because of the very heavy loads, it is necessary to use a transmission with many gears to be able to obtain reasonable acceleration across a wide range of speeds–accelerating from a stop at an intersection to highway speeds of 70 mi/h. Commercial truck transmissions usually have 10-12 forward gears, as well as multiple reverse gears. The Detroit DT12 transmission, for example, consists of 12 forward gears and 4 reverse gears. Figure 4.3: Detroit DT12 Transmission For more detail, including equations, about tractive effort see Mannering and Washburn (2019). 4.1.2 Resistance Forces The primary forces that resist tractive effort are: Aerodynamic Grade Rolling Aerodynamic Resistance This force is a function of air density, frontal area, drag coefficient, and vehicle speed (squared). Commercial trucks have larger frontal areas (approximated as the product of width and height of the front of the vehicle) and coefficients of drag. For example, the frontal area of a tractor truck is approximately 63.8 square ft (7.5 ft (width) \\(\\times\\) 8.5 ft (height)). Whereas, the frontal area of a common passenger vehicle, say a Honda Accord is only approximately 29.3 square ft (6.1 ft (width) \\(\\times\\) 4.8 ft (height)). Drag coefficients for automobiles range from 0.25 - 0.55 (unitless). Sedan-style vehicles (e.g., Honda Accord) will have drag coefficients on the lower end of this range. SUVs and pick-up trucks will have drag coefficients on the higher end of this range. Drag coefficients for tractor-trailers range from 0.6-1.3. Tractors with roof and side fairings will generally have drag coefficients on the lower end of this range. (Source: Tables 2.2 and 2.3, Mannering and Washburn (2019)) For level terrain and highway speeds, aerodynamic resistance is usually the most significant of the three forces for any vehicle. For tractor-trailers versus passenger vehicles, however, this force will be much greater due to the larger frontal area and drag coefficient, all else being equal. Rolling Resistance This force is a function of vehicle weight and a coefficient of rolling resistance value, which is a function of vehicle velocity. This force will also be much greater for a tractor-trailer relative to a passenger vehicle due to the much greater weight for the tractor-trailer. Grade Resistance This force is a function of vehicle weight and roadway incline. For any roadway upgrade, this force will also be much greater for a tractor-trailer relative to a passenger vehicle due to the much greater weight for the tractor-trailer. For more detail, including equations, about these resistance forces see Mannering and Washburn (2019). 4.1.3 Practical Acceleration Values Despite the greater power and torque output of a tractor truck powertrain relative to most passenger vehicles, the much greater resistance forces for a tractor-trailer generally result in much poorer acceleration performance than for passenger vehicles. The maximum For heavily loaded trucks, in the range of 60-80,000 lbs, maximum acceleration rates from rest (i.e., a stopped condition) and on level terrain are on the order of 3.5 ft/s/s. This maximum acceleration rate decreases, in a roughly linearly fashion, with increasing speed up to a maximum speed of approximately 75 mi/h. At maximum speed, the acceleration capability is zero, as the sum of the resistance forces equals the powertrain output force. On upgrades, acceleration performance is typically very poor for heavily-loaded trucks. For steep upgrades, 5% and higher, trucks often can only maintain speeds of 30-40 mi/h, sometimes referred to as a ‘crawl speed’, as this is much less than the posted speed limit on major highways. Figure 4.4 illustrates the impact of roadway upgrade on maximum speed for a heavily loaded tractor-trailer Figure 4.4: Truck acceleration/speed performance on upgrades Source: Ozkul and Washburn (2015) In contrast, maximum acceleration rates for passenger vehicles, from rest and on level terrain, can easily exceed 10 ft/s/s for all but the most low performance vehicles. High performance passenger vehicles can realize acceleration rates as large as 20 ft/s/s. Maximum speeds for most passenger cars can also exceed 100 mi/h. Additionally, upgrades have much less impact on acceleration rates and maximum speed for passenger vehicles than for commercial trucks. See Ozkul and Washburn (2015) and Washburn and Ozkul (2013) for more information. References "],["deceleration.html", "4.2 Deceleration", " 4.2 Deceleration Deceleration, or braking, is largely a function of braking technology (e.g., drum brakes versus disc brakes), weight distribution across the braking axles, and height of the vehicle’s center of gravity. Generally, the braking performance for tractor-trailers is much poorer than that for passenger vehicles. This is because of the tractor-trailer’s high center of gravity, the greater difficulty of achieving optimal weight distribution relative to the braking axles, and relatively poor braking mechanical efficiency. The latter issue is a result of the large and challenging axle configuration of tractor-trailers. "],["traffic-operations-considerations.html", "4.3 Traffic Operations Considerations", " 4.3 Traffic Operations Considerations The combination of large size and poor acceleration performance for tractor-trailers can result in significant traffic operations impacts. The saturation flow rate at signalized intersections is one example. Figures 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 illustrate the relative impact on the queue length (in distance) by tractor-trailers. Figure 4.5: Example of Queuing at a Signalized Intersection with Tractor-Trailers (1) Source: Washburn and Cruz-Casas (2010) Figure 4.6: Example of Queuing at a Signalized Intersection with Tractor-Trailers (2) Photo Source: Scott S. Washburn Figure 4.7: Example of Queuing at a Signalized Intersection with Tractor-Trailers (3) Photo Source: Scott S. Washburn The added queue distance combined with the relatively poor acceleration of tractor-trailers results in reduced saturation flow rates, and consequently capacity, at signalized intersections. Figure 4.8 illustrates how an increasing percentage of tractor-trailers in the traffic stream reduces the saturation flow rate at a signalized intersection. A saturation flow rate of approximately 1800 veh/h/ln corresponds to a traffic stream of only passenger vehicles. Figure 4.8: Signalized Intersection Saturation Flow Rate vs Percentage of Tractor-Trailers Source: Ozkul and Washburn (2019) On uninterrupted flow roadways, such as freeways, these same issues–relatively larger size and poorer acceleration compared with passenger vehicles–are accounted for on traffic stream performance through a passenger car equivalent (PCE) factor. The PCE value is used to calculate a heavy vehicle factor, which in turn is used to convert a traffic stream from units of veh/h to units of passenger cars per hour (pc/h). The latter value will always be higher if the percentage of tractor-trailers in the traffic stream is not zero.

The Last Mile is a bandwidth bottleneck because there is a limit to how much data can be transferred to the customer. The Last Mile is also the most expensive because of all the equipment needed per customer and the number of customers that exist. (#fig:Figure 7.13)How Networks are Built The concept of Last Mile first started with the telecommunications industry. But it has since branched out to other Industries. Most notably, the Transportation Industry The remainder of this lecture will discuss First/Last Mile, and how it relates to transportation. (#fig:Figure 7.14)Relation with Transportation "],["SupplyChain-relation.html", "7.17 How does it relate to Transportation?", " 7.17 How does it relate to Transportation? Whether ”First” or “Last Mile”, they both serve as connectors that either initiate or end a trip. In Transportation, there are two types or trips being done: The Movement of Goods The Movement of People The First Mile isn’t as much of an issue when delivering goods compared to people… more on this later. (#fig:Figure 7.15)How does it relate to Transportation Movement of Goods 1.Last Mile regarding the movement of goods is the final step in the supply chain that moves goods from the distributor/facility to the customer. 2.Last Mile usually involves parcel or small package carriers to deliver products 3.According to research done by straits, Last Mile Delivery market size is expected to reach $123 Billion USD by 2030 from the $40.5 Billion USD valuation given in 2021. 4.This is due to an increase in e-commerce and then COVID-19 further fueled the trend of ordering online. 5.The introduction of Omnichannel Supply Chains has also contributed to the market increase in Last Mile delivery. 6.In Supply Chain, traditionally the network is a Multichannel Supply Chain. This network would have departments grouped into stand alone silos with no interaction with one another. Example: A retail company would have a brick-and-mortar store and an online store. Each store would have its own supply channel such as warehouse management and transportation system. The infrastructure would only serve that one channel Since there is not overlap in the networks, overhead costs increase with less efficiency to move product. 7.Omnichannel Supply Chains, changes by integrating all networks to minimize cost and increase efficacy. Example: The retail company, whether it’s serving the brick-and-mortar store or the online store, the supply chain is designed to serve both channel simultaneously. If a customer can’t find an item in the brick-and-mortar store, they can order it online for the costumer. OR If the customer orders an Item online, they can choose to pick up the item at the brick-and-mortar store. ##Challenges? {#SupplyChain-challenge} Movement of Goods One more note on Omnichannel Supply Chains, 1.With the implementation of algorithms and predictive analytics, companies hope to be more efficient in delivering goods… But there are consequences. 2.In a lecture presentation given by Charles H.W. Edwards (Professor of the Practice, Department of City and Regional Planning UNC – Chapel Hill) to Florida Atlantic University’s Fright Mobility Research Institute, Dr. Edwards presented on companies urge to anticipate orders for the purpose of faster shipping. 3.E-commerce and online stores would look at trends generated by the number of clicks on their websites and then order products on the assumption that the consumer will eventually click the buy button. 4.The companies would order product before generating a sale and cause further unneeded stress for the First and Middle Mile, often… the consumer would never click the buy button, but the product would already be shipped from the manufacture to the distribution hub. 5.Traffic Congestion and Parking are the main issues that affect Last Mile Deliveries. 6.Distribution hubs are usually located far from the cities in more rural areas. Land is cheaper and available, more ample space for large trucks to move in and out of facilities. 7.But to move goods from the distribution hub to the final-destination (Last Mile), the challenge is traffic encountered in densely packed cities, accidents and other unforeseen events make delivery route optimization very difficult. 8.Finding parking in order to deliver goods can sometimes be difficult. "],["SupplyChain-Soln.html", "7.18 Solutions?", " 7.18 Solutions? Movement of Goods 1.One way the industry can combat last mile challenges. Is by opening a secondary distribution hub outside the major city limits. Goods would go from the regional distribution center to this secondary distribution hub. Then the goods are closer to final-destination in the city. 2.Making the distance for the last mile smaller. 3.But the real solution comes from the type of vehicle used to distribute the the goods in the city 4.Proposed Solutions: Delivery lockers, example: Amazon’s storefront pickup locations.

This project considered to reevaluate freight providers traditional approach of positioning their distributions centers. This is because the traditional approach causes traffic congestion, increased emissions and higher delay. This project focused on a sustainable and cost-efficient approach by developing a a multi-objective framework for the facility location problem, NP-Hard optimization problem. The model selects an optimal number of locations to create “mini hubs” inside the urban areas. The trucks would arrive at the “mini facilities and unload the goods. The goods are then delivered (Last-Mile) via eco-friendly transportation modes (handcarts, bicycles, self-picked up) to the final destinations, This project explores sustainable delivery solutions while simultaneously improving urban freight mobility. Integrate Autonomous delivery Vehicle Into Sustainable Urban Logistics Planning and Optimization. This project considered autonomous delivery vehicles as a novel approach to improve urban logistics and more specifically, improve the Last-Mile-Delivery. The reason this project was initiated is due to the current trend of sustainable urban distribution hubs which they are smaller logistic centers to be placed in the city. Studies show that drone delivery services are better suited for rural and suburban locations. But autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) are best suited for urban city centers. Specifically, ADVs should be used as ground bases delivery services to address the Last-Mile-Delivery. The reduce road traffic, no need for parking, The primary objective is to identify an urban logistic optimization model while minimizing operations cost and carbon footprint.

The advent of the modern container brought a decline of inland ports as they were no longer able to support massive container ships. Seaports built along deep waterways became the predominant terminal for shipping. With the use of containers, products were safely sealed reducing pilfering and overall damages. Containers also reduced the labor requirements within ports as cranes took the place of large longshoremen crews.

Severity levels-Highway Safety Manual F (Fatal crash): a police-reported crash involving a motor vehicle in transport on a trafficway in which at least one person dies within 30 days of the crash. I (Injury crash): a police-reported crash that involves a motor vehicle in transport on a trafficway in which no one died but at least one person was reported to have: (i) an incapacitating injury; (ii) a visible but not incapacitating injury; (iii) a possible, not visible injury; or (iv) an injury of unknown severity. PDO (Property damage only): a police- reported crash involving a motor vehicle in transport on a trafficway in which no one involved in the crash suffered any injuries.

It can impair your driving, similar to alcohol impairment. What causes fatigue? Being awake for many consecutive hours. Not getting enough sleep over multiple days. Time of day: Your body has a sleep/wake cycle that tells you when to be alert and when it’s time to sleep. The urge to sleep is the most intense in the early morning hours. Monotonous tasks or long periods of inactivity. Health factors such as sleep disorders or medications that cause drowsiness. What are the effects of driver fatigue? Nodding off. Reacting more slowly to changing road conditions, other drivers, or pedestrians. Making poor decisions. Drifting from your lane. Experiencing “tunnel vision” (when you lose sense of what’s going on in the periphery) Experiencing “microsleeps” (brief sleep episodes lasting from a fraction of a second up to 30 seconds). Forgetting the last few miles you drove. How to avoid driver fatigue? Getting adequate sleep on a daily basis is the only true way to protect yourself against the risks of driving when you’re drowsy. Experts urge consumers to make it a priority to get seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Before the start of a long family car trip, get a good night’s sleep, or you could put your entire family and others at risk. Many teens do not get enough sleep at a stage in life when their biological need for sleep increases, which makes them vulnerable to the risk of drowsy-driving crashes, especially on longer trips. Advise your teens to delay driving until they’re well-rested. Avoid drinking any alcohol before driving. Consumption of alcohol interacts with sleepiness to increase drowsiness and impairment. Always check your prescription and over-the-counter medication labels to see if drowsiness could result from their use. If you take medications that could cause drowsiness as a side effect, use public transportation when possible. If you drive, avoid driving during the peak sleepiness periods (midnight – 6 a.m. and late afternoon). If you must drive during the peak sleepiness periods, stay vigilant for signs of drowsiness, such as crossing over roadway lines or hitting a rumble strip, especially if you’re driving alone. Related regulations While regulations set maximum numbers of driving and work hours for jobs such as driving a large truck, this approach doesn’t account for individual differences in sleep needs and health. Workers in most other jobs aren’t covered by regulations intended to reduce driver fatigue. Summary of Hours of Service Regulations Figure 13.4: Hours-of-service regulations Related statistics NHTSA’s census of fatal crashes and estimate of traffic-related crashes and injuries rely on police and hospital reports to determine the incidence of drowsy-driving crashes. NHTSA estimates that in 2017, 91,000 police-reported crashes involved drowsy drivers. These crashes led to an estimated 50,000 people injured and nearly 800 deaths. But there is broad agreement across the traffic safety, sleep science, and public health communities that this is an underestimate of the impact of drowsy driving. Sleepiness can result in crashes any time of the day or night, but three factors are most commonly associated with drowsy-driving crashes. (a) Occur most frequently between midnight and 6 a.m., or in the late afternoon; (b) Often involve only a single driver (and no passengers) running off the road at a high rate of speed with no evidence of braking; (c) Frequently occur on rural roads and highways.

It encompasses a range of skills, knowledge, and behaviors necessary for safe driving. Here are some key aspects of driver competency: Technical skills: This involves proficiency in handling the vehicle’s controls, such as steering, braking, accelerating, and using turn signals. Knowledge of traffic laws: Competent drivers should have a good understanding of traffic laws and regulations, including speed limits, right-of-way rules, and traffic signs and signals. Defensive driving: Competent drivers are skilled in defensive driving techniques, which involve anticipating and responding to potential hazards on the road. This includes maintaining a safe following distance, being aware of blind spots, and avoiding distractions. Situational awareness: Drivers need to be aware of their surroundings and the behavior of other road users. This includes monitoring the actions of pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers to anticipate and react to unexpected events. Judgment and Decision-Making: Competent drivers make sound decisions while driving. They assess situations quickly, prioritize safety, and choose appropriate actions to avoid accidents or dangerous situations. Emotional control: Competency also includes the ability to stay calm and composed while driving, even in stressful or challenging situations. Adaptability: Drivers should be able to adapt to changing road and weather conditions. This includes adjusting their speed and driving style in response to rain, snow, fog, or other adverse conditions. Vehicle maintenance: Competent drivers understand the importance of regular vehicle maintenance and conduct routine checks to ensure their vehicle is safe to drive. Responsible behavior: This involves refraining from behaviors that can impair driving, such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, texting while driving, or engaging in other distractions.
