Railroads and Rail-ports function as an essential platforms within global supply chains and production networks. These supply chains are ever evolving to keep up with changes in trade patterns, updated supply chain management and even new technologies. ##The Role of Rail in the Supply Chain {#SupplyChain-Railportsupplychain} 1. Railroads are considered the middleman of the supply chain. They move about 40% of long-distance U.S. freight. They are an important conduit for freight between port and last-mile truck service. As such, freight has three transportation options upon arrival at a sea port: Off-dock: involves the movement of a container between the terminal and a railroad facility via truck over a distance Near-dock: involves the movement of a container between the terminal adjacent but offsite railroad facility On-dock: involves the direct loading of the container onto a train within the same terminal as the original vessel (#fig:Figure 7.8)The Role of Rail in the Supply Chain Rail intermodal is the transportation method of moving freight across the globe by both railroad and truck. As such, Intermodal provides both a competitively priced, and environmentally friendly alternative to excessive reliance on highways to transport freight. Intermodal is focused on the 53’ capacity freight market through the use of containers that move on the rail for the long haul segment of a shipment.There are two types of domestic intermodal shipping in container-on-flatcar (COFC) and trailer-on-flatcar. (#fig:Figure 7.9)Role of Rail 6.Per the Association of American Railroads: Intermodal accounts for 25% of the revenue for major U.S. railroads- more than any other traffic category Half of the intermodal traffic is due to imports and exports 7.Aside from intermodal, railroads move commodities such as crude oil, ethanol and coal to help meet energy needs. It also moves essential chemicals such as fertilizers, plastic resins, caustic soda, and much more "],["SupplyChain-Railportservice.html", "7.11 Rail Service During Supply Chain Disruptions", " 7.11 Rail Service During Supply Chain Disruptions 1.In recent years the supply chain has been greatly impacted by the global pandemic by changes in on consumer purchasing trends, worker preferences, and rapidly changing global and national economies. 2.As the middle link in the supply network, rail service is impacted by these not only directly in how the other supply chain members interact with it. (#fig:Figure 7.10)Rail Service During Supply Chain Disruptions Rail networks have been combatting these disruptions by the following: 1.Expanding network capacity Pulling equipment out of storage / activating their reserve fleets Scheduling car movements to minimize congestion Reopening of previously dormant terminals 2.Hiring, training, deploying and retaining train crews Hiring bonuses, financial payments to refer-a-friend and other incentives to entice potential employees Incentivizing through payments to move to high-demand regions of the network Quick response to bring idled locomotives back online 3.Closely collaborating with trucks Railroads and their trucking partners work to move shipments from intermodal terminals as quickly as possible One railroad keeps a pool of truck chassis to help maximize truck hauling capacity while another railroad mounts intermodal containers on any chassis brought to it to help reduce truckers driving without any cargo "],["SupplyChain-Railportimpact.html", "7.12 The Economic Impact of Freight Railroads", " 7.12 The Economic Impact of Freight Railroads 1.Freight railroads serve nearly every industrial, wholesale, retail and resource-based sector of the American economy. 2.The operations and capital investment of the freight rail industry has been estimated to support 1.1 percent of U.S. workers. 3.Railroads account for around 1/3 of U.S. exports by volume without which we would not be competitive in the global market.

What is First Mile? Depending on the Industry it can mean many things: A manufacture may consider the First Mile when their completed goods are shipped from factory to their distribution hub. A retailer may consider the First Mile when manufactured goods are shipped from suppliers’ distribution hub to the retailer’s distribution center. E-commerce may consider the First Mile to be when the goods are transferred to the courier that will deliver the good to the costumer’s home. But in short, First Mile is when the good travels through the first leg of the supply chain. (#fig:Figure 7.11)First and Last Mile What is Last Mile? Last Mile refers to the last phase of the supply chain process for the delivery of good or people. Last Mile can be range anywhere from a couple of blocks to a couple 100 miles. The distance is determined by the network of the supply chain for the specific good being transported. Last Mile for Transporting Goods For transporting goods, the last mile may be the route taken by an Amazon driver to drop of packages. The route taken by an autonomous robot to deliver food. Last Mile for Transporting People The last mile may be the taxi used to go from the airport to arrive at a hotel. The e-bike rental used to go from the train station to work (final destination). (#fig:Figure 7.12)First and Last Mile Operation The concept of Last Mile was first introduced in the telecommunications industry. The industry’s Last Mile is the bandwidth that is delivered to the costumer. The telecommunications network is like a “tree”. Bandwidth that travels in high capacity are known as “trunks”; the trunks branch out into “twigs” which serve as the Last Mile. The Last Mile is a bandwidth bottleneck because there is a limit to how much data can be transferred to the costumer. The Last Mile is also the most expensive because of all the equipment needed per customer and the number of customers that exist. (#fig:Figure 7.13)How Networks are Built The concept of Last Mile first started with the telecommunications industry. But it has since branched out to other Industries. Most notably, the Transportation Industry The remainder of this lecture will discuss First/Last Mile, and how it relates to transportation. (#fig:Figure 7.14)Relation with Transportation "],["SupplyChain-relation.html", "7.15 How does it relate to Transportation?", " 7.15 How does it relate to Transportation? Whether ”First” or “Last Mile”, they both serve as connectors that either initiate or end a trip. In Transportation, there are two types or trips being done: The Movement of Goods The Movement of People The First Mile isn’t as much of an issue when delivering goods compared to people… more on this later. (#fig:Figure 7.15)How does it relate to Transportation Movement of Goods 1.Last Mile regarding the movement of goods is the final step in the supply chain that moves goods from the distributor/facility to the costumer. 2.Last Mile usually involves parcel or small package carriers to deliver products 3.According to research done by straits, Last Mile Delivery market size is expected to reach $123 Billion USD by 2030 from the $40.5 Billion USD valuation given in 2021. 4.This is due to an increase in e-commerce and then COVID-19 further fueled the trend of ordering online. 5.The introduction of Omnichannel Supply Chains has also contributed to the market increase in Last Mile delivery. 6.In Supply Chain, traditionally the network is a Multichannel Supply Chain. This network would have departments grouped into stand alone silos with no interaction with one another. Example: A retail company would have a brick-and-mortar store and an online store. Each store would have its own supply channel such as warehouse management and transportation system. The infrastructure would only serve that one channel Since there is not overlap in the networks, overhead costs increase with less efficiency to move product. 7.Omnichannel Supply Chains, changes by integrating all networks to minimize cost and increase efficacy. Example: The retail company, whether it’s serving the brick-and-mortar store or the online store, the supply chain is designed to serve both channel simultaneously. If a customer can’t find an item in the brick-and-mortar store, they can order it online for the costumer. OR If the customer orders an Item online, they can choose to pick up the item at the brick-and-mortar store. ##Challenges? {#SupplyChain-challenge} Movement of Goods One more note on Omnichannel Supply Chains, 1.With the implementation of algorithms and predictive analytics, companies hope to be more efficient in delivering goods… But there are consequences. 2.In a lecture presentation given by Charles H.W. Edwards (Professor of the Practice, Department of City and Regional Planning UNC – Chapel Hill) to Florida Atlantic University’s Fright Mobility Research Institute, Dr. Edwards presented on companies urge to anticipate orders for the purpose of faster shipping. 3.E-commerce and online stores would look at trends generated by the number of clicks on their websites and then order products on the assumption that the consumer will eventually click the buy button. 4.The companies would order product before generating a sale and cause further unneeded stress for the First and Middle Mile, often… the consumer would never click the buy button, but the product would already be shipped from the manufacture to the distribution hub. 5.Traffic Congestion and Parking are the main issues that affect Last Mile Deliveries. 6.Distribution hubs are usually located far from the cities in more rural areas. Land is cheaper and available, more ample space for large trucks to move in and out of facilities. 7.But to move goods from the distribution hub to the final-destination (Last Mile), the challenge is traffic encountered in densely packed cities, accidents and other unforeseen events make delivery route optimization very difficult. 8.Finding parking in order to deliver goods can sometimes be difficult. "],["SupplyChain-Soln.html", "7.16 Solutions?", " 7.16 Solutions? Movement of Goods 1.One way the industry can combat last mile challenges. Is by opening a secondary distribution hub outside the major city limits. Goods would go from the regional distribution center to this secondary distribution hub.

This is because the traditional approach causes traffic congestion, increased emissions and higher delay. This project focused on a sustainable and cost-efficient approach by developing a a multi-objective framework for the facility location problem, NP-Hard optimization problem. The model selects an optimal number of locations to create “mini hubs” inside the urban areas. The trucks would arrive at the “mini facilities and unload the goods. The goods are then delivered (Last-Mile) via eco-friendly transportation modes (handcarts, bicycles, self-picked up) to the final destinations, This project explores sustainable delivery solutions while simultaneously improving urban freight mobility. Integrate Autonomous delivery Vehicle Into Sustainable Urban Logistics Planning and Optimization. This project considered autonomous delivery vehicles as a novel approach to improve urban logistics and more specifically, improve the Last-Mile-Delivery. The reason this project was initiated is due to the current trend of sustainable urban distribution hubs which they are smaller logistic centers to be placed in the city. Studies show that drone delivery services are better suited for rural and suburban locations. But autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) are best suited for urban city centers. Specifically, ADVs should be used as ground bases delivery services to address the Last-Mile-Delivery.
