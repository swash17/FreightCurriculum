Parcel delivery vehicles (e.g., UPS, FedEx) are usually of type class 5 or 6. Vehicles in classes 6 and 7 are largely comprised of construction vehicles (e.g., dump trucks, concrete mixers). Vehicles in classes 5-7 are often referred to as single unit trucks (SUTs). This course focuses on vehicles in classifications 8-12, vehicle types most commonly used for the transportation of freight over medium- and long-haul distances. Such vehicles consist of a tractor + semi-trailer configuration. These vehicles are often informally referred to as a 'Semi-Truck' or 'Tractor-Trailer'.


## Tractor Truck

The tractor provides the motive force to pull the attached semi-trailer. The near universal design of truck tractors used in North America consist of an engine and hood over the front axle in front of the cab. Figure \@ref(fig:TractorNoSleeper) shows an example of this design. The tractor shown in this figure is often referred to as a 'Day Cab' style.

Figure \@ref(fig:TractorWithSleeper) shows an example of a 'Sleeper Cab' tractor design. This tractor includes a compartment that can be used for sleeping by the driver during overnight stops on long-haul trips.

## Semi-Trailer

A semi-trailer does not include a front axle.

Commonly used trailer types include the following (not an exhaustive list):

Box Trailer (Dry Van Trailer)
- fully enclosed
- typical cargo: non-perishable goods, construction-related products, and cargo that does not require temperature control
- typical length: 53 ft

Intermodal Trailer (Container Chassis)
- used to transport intermodal shipping containers to and from container depots, seaports, rail yards, and other shipping facilities
- typical length: 20 or 40 ft cargo container

Flatbed Trailer
- flat deck with no containment, doors, or roof to enclose loads. Thus, provide considerable flexibility for un/loading and laying out loads.
- primarily used for shipping construction materials and various equipment. Essentially, any load that does not require protection from weather and other elements can be transported using flatbed trailers.
- typical length: 48 ft, 53 ft

Side Curtain Trailer
- combines the loading benefits of a flatbed trailer with a ceiling, front wall, and rear doors for cargo containment and protection, but allows for side loading.
- Consumer goods, lumber, etc.
- typical length: 40 ft

Refrigerator Trailer (Reefer Trailer)
- equipped with a built-in temperature control system and insulation to protect temperature-sensitive shipments
- typical cargo: Food (meat, fish, dairy, etc.), Pharmaceuticals, and similar
- typical length: 48 ft, 53 ft

Tanker Trailer
- cylindrical and used to carry liquids
- typical cargo: Petrochemicals, dry food, beverages, asphalt
- typical length: 53 ft

Dry Bulk Trailers (pneumatic tankers)
- used to transport dry goods, such as flour, maize, cement, sand, and similar commodities. These tankers are fully enclosed and vacuum-sealed to prevent any type of leakage. 
- typical length: 20 ft, 40 ft

Lowboy Trailer
- features a very low deck, The primary purpose of this trailer type is to transport tall equipment or cargo without the need to obtain height permits.
- typical cargo: Large equipment and machinery, Lowboys are generally used to transport oversized materials from mining sites, bulldozers, heavy machinery, large vehicles, and excavators. 

Car Carrier Trailer (Car Hauler Trailer)
- typical cargo: Vehicles (Sedans, SUVs, trucks, etc.)

## Geometric design considerations (turning radius, sight distance, etc.)

AASHTO's "A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets", commonly referred to as the "Green Book" includes guidelines for design vehicle dimensions. Table \@ref(tab:DesignVehDimensions) lists those values for the commercial truck classifications.
