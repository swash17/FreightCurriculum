Introduction

Safety is the protection from risk, danger, or injury
Assessed through crash data

Preparedness is needed to prevent conflicts and increase safety

To reduce fatalities in injuries:
behavior analysis
infrastructure 
road design

## Importance of Enforcement and Safety Organizations {#organization-imp}
Enforcement and safety organizations aid in preparation and reduction of safety issues
They do this through roadway design, traffic law enforcement, road user behavior, and emergency response time (FDOT, 2020)
Improvements in safety are done through collaboration between different transportation disciplines.
Freight, passenger vehicles, hazardous materials, railroad, aviation, maritime, etc.
