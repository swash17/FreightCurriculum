# Safety {#Safety}

The objective measure reflected in the prevalence of crashes and their harm.

## Crash Frequency {#Safety-CrashFrequency}

1) Crash: an event that produces injury and/or property damage, involves a motor vehicle in transport, and occurs on a trafficway or while the vehicle is still in motion after running off the trafficway.

2) Crash frequency: refers to the counts the number of crashes that have occurred at a given location (along a roadway section or at an intersection) over a specified time period, typically three to five years.

## Crash Severity {#Safety-CrashSeverity}

1) Crash severity: refers to the level of seriousness or extent of harm caused by a traffic collision or accident. It is often measured based on the most severe injury sustained by a person involved in the crash.

2) Severity levels-Highway Safety Manual

* F (Fatal crash): a police-reported crash involving a motor vehicle in transport on a trafficway in which at least one person dies within 30 days of the crash.
* I (Injury crash): a police-reported crash that involves a motor vehicle in transport on a trafficway in which no one died but at least one person was reported to have: (i) an incapacitating injury; (ii) a visible but not incapacitating injury; (iii) a possible, not visible injury; or (iv) an injury of unknown severity.
* PDO (Property damage only): a police- reported crash involving a motor vehicle in transport on a trafficway in which no one involved in the crash suffered any injuries.

3) Other severity levels-KABCO

* K: Killed (fatal)
* A: Disabling injury (serious)
* B: Evident injury (moderate)
* C: Possible injury (minor)
* O: No evident injury (none)
