Truck remains the premiere mode of freight transportation through the past two decades. Further growth in the future with advancements in electric vehicles and automation. Other modes are meanwhile holding relatively stable throughout the years. Freight transportation movements are expected to increase over the next few decades as global populations grow and consumer spending power increases. The freight transportation system in the United States includes an extensive network of highways, railroads, waterways, pipelines, and airways: 958,000 miles of Federal-aid highways, 141,000 miles of railroads, 11,000 miles of inland waterways, and 1.6 million miles of pipelines.

Freight transportation increases the value of goods by moving them to locations where they are worth more and encourages competition and production. Freight transportation also stimulates demand for goods and services and employs millions of people. Freight transportation infrastructure is a significant component of our nation’s wealth and productive capacity. From a macroeconomic perspective, transportation accounts for a significant share of the U.S. GDP. In 2000, purchases of transportation-related goods and services accounted for approximately 11 percent of GDP (USDOT BTS 2002). Only housing, health care, and food accounted for a greater share. For-hire transportation services, which include warehousing, contributed about 3.3 percent ($303 billion) to GDP. Many industries and businesses depend on their own transportation operations (primarily trucking) to move goods. These “in-house” transportation services contributed an additional $142 billion to the economy (USDOT BTS 2001b). Freight transportation also contributes to the economy by providing jobs to millions of people—an important indicator of economic growth. In 2000, more than 10 million people were employed in transportation-related industries, including for-hire services, vehicle manufacturing, and parts suppliers. For-hire transportation (including warehousing) employed more than 4.4 million workers, a majority of whom worked in freight-related jobs. Another 5.5 million people worked in transportation occupations in non transportation industries, such as truck drivers for grocery stores (USDOT BTS 2001b). Truck drivers, alone, accounted for nearly 70 percent of the total number of transportation occupational workers (USDOT BTS 2002b). Improvements in freight productivity help the United States maintain its competitive position in the world economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that productivity for the intercity trucking, railroad, air transport, and petroleum pipeline industries has improved over the last 20 years. "],["intro-Freight_movement.html", "2.6 Growing Freight Movement", " 2.6 Growing Freight Movement Improvements in railroad productivity resulted primarily from deregulation, divestiture of uneconomic lines, reductions in the labor force, and changes in technology and logistics. Productivity improvements in trucking resulted primarily from public investments in a high-quality national road network and deregulation. The volume of freight moved by the U.S. transportation system has grown dramatically in recent decades and is projected to increase nearly 70 percent by 2020. The liberalization of trade policies, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), internationalization of supply chains, and changes in transportation and information technologies have contributed to this increase in freight movement. As a share of the gross domestic product (GDP), U.S. exports and imports grew from 9 percent in 1960 to 23 percent in 2002. U.S. international trade is forecast to reach 37 percent of GDP by 2025. Trucks carried about 71 percent of all tonnage and 80 percent of the value of U.S. shipments in 1998. Even with growth in airfreight, maritime, and rail services, the percentage of urban interstates carrying more than 10,000 trucks daily is expected to increase from 27 percent in 1998 to 69 percent in 2020. In recent years, trade growth has increased the number of commercial vehicles on U.S. roadways and, indirectly, the potential demand for more productive and larger commercial trucks. Trucks move a majority of freight tonnage. In 2002, 7.9 million large trucks (trucks with six or more tires) were on the road, compared with 6.2 million in 1990, and trucks contributed to 7.5 percent of all vehicle miles traveled in 2002. Trucks transported the vast majority of freight by both weight and value in 2018 (68% and 73%, respectively). While pipelines and rail together accounted for over 25% of freight tonnage, they accounted for just over 12% of freight value. Domestic freight movement in 2018 totaled 16.5 billion tons with a total value of $14.8 billion.

Once the consignment is ready, the exporter will first select a particular shipping company whose container will come to its factory for cargo loading. After loading the containers, the containers are sealed and an identical no. or a particular id is given to the exporter so that they can track their goods. Now the Freight forwarder will arrange for the intermodal transport i.e. transporting the container from the exporter warehouse or factory to the designated shipping port for loading into the ships. Shipping: In the port, the container weights are measured, and the entries are made according to that. The container is stacked in the port in such a manner that they can be taken out easily as per the schedule of their assigned vessel. Now the container is ready to be loaded on the ship. Once the ship arrives, the container is brought from the port storage facility, near to the ship by container port trucks The container can be stored on the ship’s cargo hold, where container guides are provided to draw and place the container inside the hold. Once the ship reaches the destined port, the container will be unloaded by the port cranes, and it is transported to the port bay or warehouse using the port container trucks. Once the custody of the shipment is acquired by the Importer’s representative or by the freight forwarder, the cargo will be transported using intermodal transport to the importer’s warehouse where the container is unloaded. The empty container is now returned to the shipping line designated container yard, where it will wait for the next booking and onward journey.

Railroads and Rail-ports function as an essential platforms within global supply chains and production networks. These supply chains are ever evolving to keep up with changes in trade patterns, updated supply chain management and even new technologies. ##The Role of Rail in the Supply Chain {#SupplyChain-Railportsupplychain} 1. Railroads are considered the middleman of the supply chain. They move about 40% of long-distance U.S. freight. They are an important conduit for freight between port and last-mile truck service. As such, freight has three transportation options upon arrival at a sea port: Off-dock: involves the movement of a container between the terminal and a railroad facility via truck over a distance Near-dock: involves the movement of a container between the terminal adjacent but offsite railroad facility On-dock: involves the direct loading of the container onto a train within the same terminal as the original vessel (#fig:Figure 7.8)The Role of Rail in the Supply Chain Rail intermodal is the transportation method of moving freight across the globe by both railroad and truck. As such, Intermodal provides both a competitively priced, and environmentally friendly alternative to excessive reliance on highways to transport freight. Intermodal is focused on the 53’ capacity freight market through the use of containers that move on the rail for the long haul segment of a shipment.There are two types of domestic intermodal shipping in container-on-flatcar (COFC) and trailer-on-flatcar. (#fig:Figure 7.9)Role of Rail 6.Per the Association of American Railroads: Intermodal accounts for 25% of the revenue for major U.S. railroads- more than any other traffic category Half of the intermodal traffic is due to imports and exports 7.Aside from intermodal, railroads move commodities such as crude oil, ethanol and coal to help meet energy needs. It also moves essential chemicals such as fertilizers, plastic resins, caustic soda, and much more "],["SupplyChain-Railportservice.html", "7.11 Rail Service During Supply Chain Disruptions", " 7.11 Rail Service During Supply Chain Disruptions 1.In recent years the supply chain has been greatly impacted by the global pandemic by changes in on consumer purchasing trends, worker preferences, and rapidly changing global and national economies. 2.As the middle link in the supply network, rail service is impacted by these not only directly in how the other supply chain members interact with it. (#fig:Figure 7.10)Rail Service During Supply Chain Disruptions Rail networks have been combatting these disruptions by the following: 1.Expanding network capacity Pulling equipment out of storage / activating their reserve fleets Scheduling car movements to minimize congestion Reopening of previously dormant terminals 2.Hiring, training, deploying and retaining train crews Hiring bonuses, financial payments to refer-a-friend and other incentives to entice potential employees Incentivizing through payments to move to high-demand regions of the network Quick response to bring idled locomotives back online 3.Closely collaborating with trucks Railroads and their trucking partners work to move shipments from intermodal terminals as quickly as possible One railroad keeps a pool of truck chassis to help maximize truck hauling capacity while another railroad mounts intermodal containers on any chassis brought to it to help reduce truckers driving without any cargo "],["SupplyChain-Railportimpact.html", "7.12 The Economic Impact of Freight Railroads", " 7.12 The Economic Impact of Freight Railroads 1.Freight railroads serve nearly every industrial, wholesale, retail and resource-based sector of the American economy. 2.The operations and capital investment of the freight rail industry has been estimated to support 1.1 percent of U.S. workers. 3.Railroads account for around 1/3 of U.S. exports by volume without which we would not be competitive in the global market.

What is First Mile? Depending on the Industry it can mean many things: A manufacture may consider the First Mile when their completed goods are shipped from factory to their distribution hub. A retailer may consider the First Mile when manufactured goods are shipped from suppliers’ distribution hub to the retailer’s distribution center. E-commerce may consider the First Mile to be when the goods are transferred to the courier that will deliver the good to the costumer’s home. But in short, First Mile is when the good travels through the first leg of the supply chain. (#fig:Figure 7.11)First and Last Mile What is Last Mile? Last Mile refers to the last phase of the supply chain process for the delivery of good or people. Last Mile can be range anywhere from a couple of blocks to a couple 100 miles. The distance is determined by the network of the supply chain for the specific good being transported. Last Mile for Transporting Goods For transporting goods, the last mile may be the route taken by an Amazon driver to drop of packages. The route taken by an autonomous robot to deliver food. Last Mile for Transporting People The last mile may be the taxi used to go from the airport to arrive at a hotel. The e-bike rental used to go from the train station to work (final destination). (#fig:Figure 7.12)First and Last Mile Operation The concept of Last Mile was first introduced in the telecommunications industry. The industry’s Last Mile is the bandwidth that is delivered to the costumer. The telecommunications network is like a “tree”. Bandwidth that travels in high capacity are known as “trunks”; the trunks branch out into “twigs” which serve as the Last Mile. The Last Mile is a bandwidth bottleneck because there is a limit to how much data can be transferred to the costumer. The Last Mile is also the most expensive because of all the equipment needed per customer and the number of customers that exist. (#fig:Figure 7.13)How Networks are Built The concept of Last Mile first started with the telecommunications industry. But it has since branched out to other Industries. Most notably, the Transportation Industry The remainder of this lecture will discuss First/Last Mile, and how it relates to transportation. (#fig:Figure 7.14)Relation with Transportation "],["SupplyChain-relation.html", "7.15 How does it relate to Transportation?", " 7.15 How does it relate to Transportation? Whether ”First” or “Last Mile”, they both serve as connectors that either initiate or end a trip. In Transportation, there are two types or trips being done: The Movement of Goods The Movement of People The First Mile isn’t as much of an issue when delivering goods compared to people… more on this later. (#fig:Figure 7.15)How does it relate to Transportation Movement of Goods 1.Last Mile regarding the movement of goods is the final step in the supply chain that moves goods from the distributor/facility to the costumer. 2.Last Mile usually involves parcel or small package carriers to deliver products 3.According to research done by straits, Last Mile Delivery market size is expected to reach $123 Billion USD by 2030 from the $40.5 Billion USD valuation given in 2021. 4.This is due to an increase in e-commerce and then COVID-19 further fueled the trend of ordering online. 5.The introduction of Omnichannel Supply Chains has also contributed to the market increase in Last Mile delivery. 6.In Supply Chain, traditionally the network is a Multichannel Supply Chain. This network would have departments grouped into stand alone silos with no interaction with one another. Example: A retail company would have a brick-and-mortar store and an online store. Each store would have its own supply channel such as warehouse management and transportation system. The infrastructure would only serve that one channel Since there is not overlap in the networks, overhead costs increase with less efficiency to move product. 7.Omnichannel Supply Chains, changes by integrating all networks to minimize cost and increase efficacy. Example: The retail company, whether it’s serving the brick-and-mortar store or the online store, the supply chain is designed to serve both channel simultaneously. If a customer can’t find an item in the brick-and-mortar store, they can order it online for the costumer. OR If the customer orders an Item online, they can choose to pick up the item at the brick-and-mortar store. ##Challenges? {#SupplyChain-challenge} Movement of Goods One more note on Omnichannel Supply Chains, 1.With the implementation of algorithms and predictive analytics, companies hope to be more efficient in delivering goods… But there are consequences. 2.In a lecture presentation given by Charles H.W. Edwards (Professor of the Practice, Department of City and Regional Planning UNC – Chapel Hill) to Florida Atlantic University’s Fright Mobility Research Institute, Dr. Edwards presented on companies urge to anticipate orders for the purpose of faster shipping. 3.E-commerce and online stores would look at trends generated by the number of clicks on their websites and then order products on the assumption that the consumer will eventually click the buy button. 4.The companies would order product before generating a sale and cause further unneeded stress for the First and Middle Mile, often… the consumer would never click the buy button, but the product would already be shipped from the manufacture to the distribution hub. 5.Traffic Congestion and Parking are the main issues that affect Last Mile Deliveries. 6.Distribution hubs are usually located far from the cities in more rural areas. Land is cheaper and available, more ample space for large trucks to move in and out of facilities. 7.But to move goods from the distribution hub to the final-destination (Last Mile), the challenge is traffic encountered in densely packed cities, accidents and other unforeseen events make delivery route optimization very difficult. 8.Finding parking in order to deliver goods can sometimes be difficult. "],["SupplyChain-Soln.html", "7.16 Solutions?", " 7.16 Solutions? Movement of Goods 1.One way the industry can combat last mile challenges. Is by opening a secondary distribution hub outside the major city limits. Goods would go from the regional distribution center to this secondary distribution hub.

This is because the traditional approach causes traffic congestion, increased emissions and higher delay. This project focused on a sustainable and cost-efficient approach by developing a a multi-objective framework for the facility location problem, NP-Hard optimization problem. The model selects an optimal number of locations to create “mini hubs” inside the urban areas. The trucks would arrive at the “mini facilities and unload the goods. The goods are then delivered (Last-Mile) via eco-friendly transportation modes (handcarts, bicycles, self-picked up) to the final destinations, This project explores sustainable delivery solutions while simultaneously improving urban freight mobility. Integrate Autonomous delivery Vehicle Into Sustainable Urban Logistics Planning and Optimization. This project considered autonomous delivery vehicles as a novel approach to improve urban logistics and more specifically, improve the Last-Mile-Delivery. The reason this project was initiated is due to the current trend of sustainable urban distribution hubs which they are smaller logistic centers to be placed in the city. Studies show that drone delivery services are better suited for rural and suburban locations. But autonomous delivery vehicles (ADVs) are best suited for urban city centers. Specifically, ADVs should be used as ground bases delivery services to address the Last-Mile-Delivery.

(#fig:Figure 10.4)Educational Awareness (#fig:Figure 10.5)Programs National Consumer Complaint Database (NCCDB): The NCCDB is a database created to allow the general public to input complaints, observations, and comments considering unsafe actions committed by motor carrier’s employees and companies. Look Before You Book: This program allows for the general public to research the licensing, insurance, and history of transit companies. This allows consumers to make an informed decision when booking bus trips. (#fig:Figure 10.6)Educational Awareness-USDOT (#fig:Figure 10.7)National Consumer Complaint Database (NCCDB) Stakeholders and Special Interest Lobby Groups: The FMCSA enables a collective review system for truck drivers, trucking companies, and special interest groups to analyze and decide on rulings. The process is called the Notice of proposed Rule making, while they go to Congress and undergo approval. The rules that are reviewed, and approved, then get rendered into code. 10.1.4 Grants Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program Grant (MCSAP) This grant program was created to provide aid to the states, by distributing funding for the purpose of enacting safety programs. An example of how this grant is being used is displayed by the support the FMCSA gives state law enforcement agencies, to encourage them to enforce and monitor safety measurements. High Priority (HP) Grant This grant program is designated to enforce commercial vehicle safety plan activities. This program has an increasingly more important role as it regulates the standard for new innovative technology and connected motor vehicle safety. 10.1.5 Conclusion The overall benefits that the FMCSA contributes to the transportation field, and industry, is the standard that it continues to establish for the safety of our road systems. The FMCSA allows for labor groups, transit and trucking partners to come together and discuss regulations, while modifying previous codes. This agency contributes to maintaining the transportation system, and its relationship with innovative technology.
